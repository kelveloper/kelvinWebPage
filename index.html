      About Kelvin 
    </h3>
    <p> 
      After graduating college, the COVID-19 panadmic was still a thing. Jobs weren't available, so I spent most of my time home investing, learning about NFTs,
      selling items online. I got into learning coding as well because it is the career of the future; just the beginning of a new era. 
    </p>
    <!-- I will create a link to a website outside this webpage -->
    <p> 
      As a student at <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I am proud to contiune my journey to becoming a software engineer!
    </p>
    <p>
