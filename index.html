      About Kelvin 
    </h3>
    <p> 
      After graduating college, the COVID-19 pandemic was still a thing. Jobs weren't available, so I spent most of my time investing, learning about NFTs, and selling items online. In my leisure time, I often play videos games, which then inspired me to create games on platforms such as Roblox Studio. 
    </p>
    <!-- I will create a link to a website outside this webpage -->
    <p> If anyone is interested in coding software to create better predictions for cryptocurrencies or loves designing games, I would love to work with you!
     
    </p>
    <p> 
       As a student at <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I am proud to continue my journey to becoming a software engineer or maybe even a game developer!
